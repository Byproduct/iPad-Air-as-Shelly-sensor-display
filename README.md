Put this script on a server and set it to run every 10 minutes or so. (Page refreshes automatically every 10 minutes, can be adjusted in template.html.)

Point your browser to the generated sensors.html file.

On an ipad you can get a full-screen browser window by first opening the page in Safari normally, then adding the page (as a shortcut) to the home screen, and then using this shortcut.
